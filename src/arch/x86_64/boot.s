# The multiboot standard does not define the value of the stack pointer register
# (esp) and it is up to the kernel to provide a stack. This allocates room for a
# small stack by creating a symbol at the bottom of it, then allocating 16384
# bytes for it, and finally creating a symbol at the top. The stack grows
# downwards on x86. The stack is in its own section so it can be marked nobits,
# which means the kernel file is smaller because it does not contain an
# uninitialized stack. The stack on x86 must be 16-byte aligned according to the
# System V ABI standard and de-facto extensions. The compiler will assume the
# stack is properly aligned and failure to align the stack will result in
# undefined behavior.

	# The bootloader has loaded us into 32-bit protected mode on a x86
	# machine. Interrupts are disabled. Paging is disabled. The processor
	# state is as defined in the multiboot standard. The kernel has full
	# control of the CPU. The kernel can only make use of hardware features
	# and any code it provides as part of itself. There's no printf
	# function, unless the kernel provides its own <stdio.h> header and a
	# printf implementation. There are no security restrictions, no
	# safeguards, no debugging mechanisms, only what the kernel provides
	# itself. It has absolute and complete power over the
	# machine.

	# To set up a stack, we set the esp register to point to the top of our
	# stack (as it grows downwards on x86 systems). This is necessarily done
	# in assembly as languages such as C cannot function without a stack.

	# processor is not fully initialized yet: Features such as floating
	# point instructions and instruction set extensions are not initialized
	# yet. The GDT should be loaded here. Paging should be enabled here.
	# C++ features such as global constructors and exceptions will require
	# runtime support to work as well.
